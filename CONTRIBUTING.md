## Getting Started

Instructions for initial setup can be found in the [README](README.md).

## NPM Command Reference

##### `npm install`

Installs all `dependencies` listed in the root `package.json`.

##### `npm run test`

The script associated with `npm run test` will run all tests that ensures that your commit does not break anything in the
repository. This will run the lint, integration and unit tests.

##### `npm run lint`
Runs the lint checks in the project.

##### `npm run generate-api-schema`
Generates the API schema in the file `public/apiSchema.json`.

## Generating Authentication Token
- Run the project locally, make sure the server is listening to requests
- Open a new tab in the browser
- Open the `Network` tab in Browsers Developer Tools
- Make sure the `Preserve log` checkbox is selected
    <br />
    ![Preserve logs checkbox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26569942/102855521-cea32880-444a-11eb-84e3-02ee6fa5b830.png)
- Navigate to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>` in the same tab
- Authorize the application.
- In the browsers Dev tools Network tab, look for `<HOST>/auth/github/callback?code=<SOME_AUTOGENERATED_CODE>` request. This is the response that actually sets the cookie on the website. If we are making the call from localhost, it will not be honoured by the browser, but we can manually copy the cookie from **Response Headers** and use it for our Postman and Swagger calls.

- Use the cookie for authenticated routes in the API.
- For non-production environments, authentication is also supported with the `Authorization` header.
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Pull request guidelines
- Ensure that the tests pass locally before raising a PR.
- All pull requests should be to the develop branch. 
- Every pull request should have associated issue(s) on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend/issues).
- For any non-trivial fixes and features, unit and integration tests must be added. The PR reviewer should not approve/merge PR(s) that lack these.
- The PR(s) should be merged only after the CI passes.
